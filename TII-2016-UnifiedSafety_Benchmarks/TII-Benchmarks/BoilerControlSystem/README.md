Boiler Control System
=====================
Boiler control system ensures safety of the operators and workers by avoiding pressure overload hazard. A pressure
sensor and a control valve sense and relieve the pressure in the cylinder. Two flow indicators are mounted in
1-out-of-2 (1oo2) redundant fashion to confirm that the valve is indeed open. A software controller running on a
programmable logic controller (PLC) orchestrates pressure relief using the sensors and actuators. As a second
measure of safety, a rupture disc is installed on the cylinder to avoid any catastrophic failure. The system can
also issue a timely warning for evacuation.

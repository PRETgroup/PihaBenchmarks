Fire Alarm System
=================
Fire alarm system is a fire detection and suppression system that uses three (3) heat and smoke sensors
to detect fire. When a fire is detected by either of the three sensors, an alarm is raised. However,
multiple (2 out of 3) detections are required for opening the sprinklers that are controlled by electric
control valves.

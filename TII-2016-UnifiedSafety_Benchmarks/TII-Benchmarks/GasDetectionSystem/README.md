Gas Detection System
====================
The gas detection system avoid hazardous gases to inflict harm on the workers. For example, a furnace in
a factory may release hazardous hydrocarbon gases, such as carbon dioxide. A safe level of these gases
can be used as a threshold value to start up the ventilation sub-system. This ventilation may be safely
turned off if the gas build-up-levels fall below the threshold.

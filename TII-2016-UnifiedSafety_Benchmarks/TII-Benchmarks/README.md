Introduction
============
This folder contains benchmarks used for the paper titled *Unified Functional Safety Assessment of Industrial Automation Systems* submitted to IEEE TII and is under review. This archive provides all information needed to recreate the results presented in the paper including the following:

1. Illustration to help understand the system (BoilerControlSystem)
2. Function Block models, implemented example systems including execution control charts, algorithms and FB networks.
3. PRISM models generated using the transformation rules presented in the paper.
4. Extended PRISM models, extended manually in accordance to the recommendations presented in the paper.
5. Verification properties used in PRISM for the purpose of probabilistic verification.

Results
=======
The results of the analysis presented  in the paper are also contained here in the form of spreadsheets contained in file
**PRISMResults.xlsx**. Each of the included subfolder contains a README.md file describing the system and provides instructions
to recreate these results.

System Configuration
====================
These results were obtained on a Windows PC with an Intel Core i5 processor with 8 GB of RAM. Two different versions of PRISM
model checker (v4.2.1 and v4.3) were used with their default settings.
